# Project 2: EGCG vs 8AZS Docking Study
# Objective:
Docking of **EGCG (Epigallocatechin gallate)** with **8azs protein target** to study binding affinity and interaction sites.

# Files Included:
- EGCG.pdbqt → Ligand file
- 8azs.pdbqt → Receptor file
- coordinates.txt → Grid configuration details
- log.txt → Docking run log from AutoDock Vina
- docked.pdb → Docked output file

# Software Used:
- AutoDock Vina
- Discovery Studio

# Summary of Results:
- Best binding affinity: -5.9 kcal/mol
- Key residues involved: Val24, Ile31, Phe19, Phe20.  

# Visualization:
Below is a sample visualization screenshot from Discovery Studio:
