# Project 1: Copper vs 8AZS Docking Study
# Objective:
Docking of **CuCl2** with **8AZS protein target** to study binding affinity and interaction sites.

# Files Included:
- Copper.pdbqt → Ligand file
- 8azs.pdbqt → Receptor file
- coordinates.txt → Grid configuration details
- log.txt → Docking run log from AutoDock Vina
- docked.pdb → Docked output file

# Software Used:
- AutoDock Vina
- Discovery Studio

# Summary of Results:
- Best binding affinity: -1.7 kcal/mol
- Key residues involved: Phe20.  

# Visualization:
Below is a sample visualization screenshot from Discovery Studio:
