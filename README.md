# Molecular Docking Studies of Amyloid Beta Peptides
This repository contains molecular docking projects performed as part of my bioinformatics and computational biology learning journey. Each folder represents a separate docking study between a ligand and a target protein, Amyloid Beta peptide. The PDB ID of the peptide used is 8AZS. 


# Project Structure
- Docking of Amyloid Beta peptide with Copper
- Docking of Amyloid Beta peptide with EGCG
- Docking of Amyloid Beta peptide with Rosmarinic Acid
